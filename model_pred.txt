1. Incoming transactions - Dataset with transaction elements - variable elements:
    1.1 initAnibodyPool(N)
        1.1.1 input: pool size N
        1.1.2 output: list of antibodies
        1.1.3 type_i class Ab - objects are actual antibodies
2. Bcells - program element; Antigen - 1 transaction; An tigen to Bcell afinity (selection based on this)
3. Affinity function
4. Sort and Select higher affinity bcells (n - selection pool size)
5. Clone/mutate selection pool elements - use clonal factor beta (var)
6. Kill unstimulated (lower affinity) Bcells - degree/bar for less affinity logic
7. replacement set d - replace d no of lowest affinity anibodies with random ones
8. random body generating function (d)
9. during creation of clone set:
    9.1.1 increase no of clones and decrease degree of mutation as affinity increases
    9.1.2 replace best new generation bcell(p) with best antiBody pool(q) if affinity(p)>affinity(q)
10. replace the d lowest affinity bcells by new generated bcells
note: Antigen = 1; kNN for affinity
define ab ag structure


Affinity - Hamming Distance Binary
         - Euclidean Distance and Weighted Average
         - Cosine

m - memory pool
r - reminder pool
